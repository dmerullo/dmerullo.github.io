    "text": "Compass and Candle.\nWith only one, you miss what you can see with the other.\nI started out as a kid reading books and writing stories. I always thought that this wasn’t really a path to a career, but rather that the skills used in understanding dense texts and producing original, argumentative analyses would come in handy across a wide range of fields. I still won’t disagree entirely with this, I guess. At some point towards the end of high school and into college, I made a pivot into the sciences, thinking that the path forward would always be quantitative, and the time spent lost in novels and poetry would just be fond memories.\nI went about as far as you can go, completing a B.S., Ph.D., and post-doctoral research in neuroscience, up to submitting an application for a tenure-track faculty position abroad and then deciding not to send out any more.\nIt wasn’t until I opted-out of the academic system that I regained the freedom to pursue non-specific interests, including within the sciences, as I did prior to specializing. This wasn’t an intentional turn; I just found myself having more time to think productively without worrying about applying for the next round of funding, or how hypothetical peer reviewers would respond to my next journal submission. I won’t carry on about this burn-out, as I have nothing new to bring, except for maybe one observation.\nWhen you dedicate your working focus to a single, highly-narrow topic, you reach the limit of not just what you know about it, but what the world knows about it. It’s a unique feeling, and it’s not something you reach in effort; it suddenly hits you one day, after you’ve pored over the same sources again and again, repeated the same conversations with your colleagues– who also know as much as you do– and you realize… you have no more questions. All of your wonder is already out there, unanswered, waiting to be tested and studied. This is the dream, isn’t it, when your research topic feels so wide open, that any result would be a breakthrough?\nFor many people– and rightfully so– this is the goal. This means you’ve struck gold, and your path forward will be here, digging each year a little deeper, building a little higher, constructing a new edifice of knowledge from what was previously scattered gravel. For me, though, it wasn’t the feeling I was looking for. I didn’t think that pushing further would really have produced the results I needed. I may be alone in this, or maybe not, which is why I’m writing and sharing this. Rather than feeling free, I instead felt trapped. I didn’t put all this time into this one specific topic to become an expert on it, and only it: I had wanted to emerge wiser in the end, with a broader and sharper perspective, where answering this one question would allow me to answer other, seemingly unrelated questions with a fresh mind.\nThat’s not to say that those perspective wouldn’t be possible, or that this effort didn’t already yield such insights. It did. I just realized that as a way in life, this wasn’t what I wanted.\nI think that I had used the compass to travel as far as I could go, to the edge of the map and maybe a little beyond, guided by the precise sensing of the external magnetic field that never erred. It’s amazing, really, where we can go with such technology; only birds seem to do better on their own. I would never want to get rid of my compass. It’s just that, when I got back home, and took out my candle, I saw a world that I’d realized I’d neglected, a world that wasn’t always clear in the corners and sometimes mislead me, but it was a world that felt familiar, and a world that never seemed like it would finish.\nI learned a lot with my compass. And I’m back to learning with my candle again, too. It feels nice to spark some warmth."

    "text": "I never thought I would read Carl Jung. He’s a footnote in psychology, right? A historical figure around the time of Freud, who had a bunch of non-falsifiable theories about the psyche, dreams, and things like that? That was pretty much how Jung was introduced every time I encountered him in neuroscience contexts. From a data-driven, biomedical perspective, it’s not an entirely inaccurate characterization. Since Jung was born in 1875, though, we shouldn’t expect him to have a mechanistic understanding of the nervous system, which didn’t really form until decades later.\nThat, for me, was when it clicked: when I realized that Jung works at a level of abstraction above the nervous system. He’s not describing the brain, like how a researcher might try to uncover neural circuits that mediate social behaviors. Jung’s attempting to address the mind, the world of our conscious and unconscious thought. Believe me, though, I am not a dualist: I don’t think that the mind is something separate from the brain.\nYet, I do think that what we experience, our moment-to-moment embodiment of reality, cannot be reduced to something like the activity of a brain region, or the presence of a neurotransmitter, or a change in gene expression. Sure, those mechanisms may ultimately lead to a particular behavioral output, but they don’t explain what it feels like as that behavior occurs to the conscious entity. And how could it? Until there’s a way to de-encrypt every single possible neural recording at every single moment, as if reading sheet music, we don’t truly know the source code inside our heads. That leaves a lot of room to think about what may be going on.\nIn modern terms, Jung was a therapist. He may have had a medical degree and practiced as a psychiatrist, but he didn’t prescribe medications. His goal was to help clients cope with troubles in their lives through dialogue. In my reading of Jung, his attempt to treat what he called “neuroses”– only some of which today would be considered mental illness– opens an entirely new window to understand our consciousness, whether he intended that or not. Applying Jung’s approach has proven inspirational to me in many areas beyond mental health, ranging from creativity and artistic analysis to interpersonal relationships and individual development.\nUnfortunately, in order for Jung to really resonate with me, I had to first enter into a rather dark place, which Jung then helped me through. Some part of me wonders, of course, if I just fooled myself as a way to ease the pain. I want to use this essay as a chance to highlight why I find Jung’s framework so appealing, and why I think others may benefit from appreciating his thought more, without first needing to face what I faced.\n\nJung’s structure of the psyche hinges on the balance of opposing forces, directly inspired by the circular mandalas of Eastern religions and philosophies (as shown here on the right of his cover for Man and His Symbols from 1964.) Note that diagrams like the one on the left are not made by Jung himself, instead coming from decidedly non-scientific sources like The Middle Pillar: The Balance between Mind and Magic by Israel Regardie.\nTo begin, it has to be emphasized that Jung did emerge as an admirer of Freud, and the two communicated closely for many years. They eventually came into a professional and personal split, resulting in two distinct approaches: “psychoanalysis” for Freud, and “analytical psychology” for Jung. This is not just psychoanalysis plus some extra stuff; Jung’s conception of the mind fundamentally differs from Freud’s, and therefore draws non-reconcilable conclusions.\nThe opening of Two Essays on Analytical Psychology (1928-1943) introduces what sets Jung’s vision apart. He explains that when counseling a patient with neurosis, Freud’s method would identify the source as a form of sexual repression. However, some alternative approaches did emerge, such as from Alfred Adler, who developed his own school with power differentials as truly underlying neurosis. Jung could carry on with other methods, but he stops here, asking now: how could two different views, each claiming absolute certainty in opposing domains, both be correct?\nIf a theory of sexual repression helped some patients, and a theory of power differentials helped another, Jung supposes that each theory may instead be capturing a subset of a broader theory of the mind– something akin to the “theory of everything” that still eludes physics. Where Freud and Adler go astray, Jung claims, is that each points to the wrong single cause for what underlies neurosis. Triumphantly, Jung declares that the true cause is not something about merely sex or power, but about an imbalance of the self.\nI know– that sounds so wishy-washy and nondescript as to be meaningless, and I think it’s why Jung’s work became associated with hippie spirituality rather than anything scientific. While what I’m about to describe still wouldn’t pass in any peer-reviewed journal, I think if you take it for what Jung used it as– practical advice to aid the struggling individual– there can be great utility, even if it’s not exactly quantifiable.\nJung’s central concept of the mind revolves around balance, supposing that our consciousness emerges from the unity of opposing forces. An imbalance in any area can lead to dysfunction somewhere else. Crucially– and this can be the hardest part to accept– the space of our balanced mind encompasses our unconsciousness, of which we are unaware. Unlike Freud, who claims that the unconscious constantly strives to dominate over regular consciousness, thus creating neurotic tension, Jung observes that the unconscious instead provides a window to information we otherwise wouldn’t access. This is best illustrated to me by Jung’s idea of the “shadow”:\n\n… A dim premonition tells us that we cannot be whole without this negative side, that we have a body which, like all bodies, casts a shadow, and that if we deny this body we cease to be three-dimensional and become flat and without substance.\n\nIn this framework, our internal fears, doubts, frustrations, angers– the emotions that torment us– are reflections of our shadow selves, the parts of us that reveal our vulnerabilities. Just as our conscious selves are not one static thing, but a process, our shadow selves evolve alongside our conscious selves.\nThe exploration of this dynamic, between self and shadow, culminates in what Jung terms individuation– the mind’s integration of the unconscious into the self. Rather than being ignored or avoided, the weaknesses and anxieties revealed in our shadows are to be understood so that that we may incorporate them and become stronger. Individuation acts as a mirror between our incomplete and whole selves, enabling us to use the past to build a better future. Or, as Jung said:\n\n… Life does not have only a yesterday, nor is it explained by reducing today to yesterday. Life has also a tomorrow, and today is understood only when we can add to our knowledge of what was yesterday the beginnings of tomorrow.\n\nIf this sounds a lot like Taoism, that’s not an accident; individuation in analytical psychology is very much “the way” of Taoism. Both philosophies are fundamentally relational, centered around the connections between concepts, rather than the essences of the concepts themselves.\n\nJung’s own artwork, best collected in The Red Book, often captures dreamlike scenes emphasizing journey and discovery as felt during individuation.\nA quick glance on Wikipedia will list many other Jungian terms that I didn’t mention– archetypes, persona, animus and anima, collective unconscious– and your mileage may vary with any or all of those. As characters in a story, I quite like them. Yet for me, seeing my shadow was enough. I found that it’s not about shining a light to erase the darkness around you. It’s about learning to move forward with only your candle, as the shadows flicker endlessly, to a place you haven’t been before, a place that challenges you.\nYes, I’m scared. I’ve also never felt so ready for this dance with the dark."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I didn’t know what it was for the longest time; I thought that’s just how things are. Besides, “anxiety” was something that other people had, something that was diagnosed, something that was medicated. How could I have anxiety?\nWell, I started to recognize patterns when my stomach churns, or my palms sweat, or my heart pounds. These responses coalesce into something more than “nervousness” or “fear” when coupled with a sense of dread. When anxiety strikes, I’m often not so much concerned with what’s happening right now as with what might happen in a bit.\nSurprisingly, it feels empowering to put a name to this phenomenon, like how Harry Potter insists on calling Voldemort by name instead of You-Know-Who. In calling out my anxiety for what it is, rather than something like insecurity or weakness, I’m able to erase its elusiveness. The following passage from Anxiety: A Philosophical Guide, by Samir Chopra, stands out to me because it describes something otherwise hard to put into words:\n\nSometimes, psychiatric medication might be needed to make working with anxiety tractable… I have yet to hear of anyone, though, who says that medication cured them of their anxiety, though it did make it more bearable, making them “functional” even if not “high achieving.” An anxiety medication is “effective” if those taking it are not incapacitated and can perform those essential tasks– personal or professional– that require their attention and work… This very functionality of the medicated breeds suspicion, of course, that anxiety medications and their overprescription are part of a “get back to work” ideology unsympathetic to the genuine existentialist crisis of the worker, the parent, the child, the young adult striving to find their way forward in a confusing and disorienting world.\n\nI’m not at all making an argument against medication or pharmaceuticals, nor am I denying the debilitating consequences of anxiety. My observation instead is that anxiety doesn’t seem to be something that can be cured, like a bacterial infection or broken bone, because anxiety isn’t an over-reactive amygdala, or an unresolved defensive mechanism of the unconscious. Anxiety is a field.\nA field? Like a plot of grass that people play sports on? I’m borrowing a term from quantum field theory here. The standard model of physics, a heavily experimentally-validated achievement of modern science, describes reality as an arrangement of “fields,” mathematical grids of variable parameters that cover all space in the universe simultaneously and endlessly.\nThey’re like the ingredients that comprise the recipes of existence. Fluctuations in the values of these fields give rise to the physical particles that we observe, like protons and electrons, just as ratios of different ingredients yield different dishes. Particles flicker in and out of momentary existence as values in these fields fluctuate wildly; yet at scale, consistent patterns emerge that we observe as reality.\n\nImagine if each color arose from the activity of a field for that color. Particular patterns could lead to things like the aurora borealis (northern lights), painted here by Frederic Church (left). The philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813-1855; right) wrote much about anxiety that is still relevant today, demonstrating its common impact.\nIn saying that anxiety is a field, I mean that it’s one of the ingredients that our mind uses in its recipe for consciousness. We wouldn’t be able to be here without it. Anxiety is what keeps us alert when we hear a bump in the night, or what pushes us to crunch for that exam. We would be far more apathetic and far less engaged if anxiety were vanquished forever. (I know some would still prefer this.)\nWhen my muscles tremble or my gut seizes up, I can better recognize that I might be caught too deep in the single field of anxiety. Bouncing back is not always as simple as going outside or watching your favorite movies, because the mischievous anxiety steals the enjoyment of those things from you. Restoring the symphony of the mind will differ for everyone, across every situation.\nIt’s a good thing, then, that space and time are so vast, with so many fields to explore, that the path to find the right balance can bring new discoveries with it. Yeah, there’s no map or directions, but why should that stop us? The next time anxiety strikes, I’ll take it as a chance to ride the fluctuations once more."
