    "text": "Genomic biomarkers\nat Parexel International\nIn my current role at a clinical research organization for a major pharmaceutical client, I perform data ingestion and develop ETL pipelines for genomic sequencing datasets (GWAS & xQTL) from clinical study populations to identify specific variations in the genome that may relate to disease and illness. As part of the biomarkers and genomic medicine team, I’m a link between the scientific analysts who require efficient management of this data at scale, and the data scientists/engineers who lack familiarity with bioinformatics methods and resources.\n\n\nNeural cell types and circuits for vocal learning in songbirds\nat University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in the Roberts lab and Konopka lab\nMy post-doctoral research used comparative high-throughput transcriptomics to understand how the brain produces complex, learned behaviors like speech and language. These projects were the first to implement single-cell RNA sequencing in songbirds, establishing a template for the field from molecular to computational components, and the results have broad implications for understanding the genetic toolkits that neurons and circuits use to perform advanced computations.\nOpen-access links to publications:\n\n(2021) Cellular transcriptomics reveals evolutionary identities of songbird vocal circuits\n(2021) Expression of FoxP2 in the basal ganglia regulates vocal motor sequences in the adult songbird\n\n\n\nNeuromodulators of motivation and reward in vocal communication\nat University of Wisconsin-Madison in the Riters lab\nMy doctoral dissertation examined the neural control of vocal communication across contexts in songbirds. I identified neurotensin, a neuropeptide involved in motivation and reward that strongly interacts with dopamine, as a potential modulator of context-specific vocalizations. By establishing links between neurotensin and vocal communication for the first time, this research also contributed to a better understanding of neurotensin’s role in the regulation of social behavior more generally.\nOpen-access links to publications:\n\n(2018) Neurotensin and neurotensin receptor 1 mRNA expression in song-control regions changes during development in male zebra finches\n(2018) Co-localization patterns of neurotensin receptor 1 and tyrosine hydroxylase in brain regions involved in motivation and social behavior in male European starlings\n(2016) Song in an affiliative context relates to the neural expression of dopamine- and neurotensin-related genes in male European starlings\n(2015) Neurotensin neural mRNA expression correlates with vocal communication and other highly-motivated social behaviors in male European starlings\n(2015) Neurotensin immunolabeling relates to sexually-motivated song and other social behaviors in male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris)"
