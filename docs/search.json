An unsupervised clustering algorithm in Python grouped the poems into 4 difficulty levels by analyzing the frequencies of 10,000+ verb forms conjugated across 18 grammatical tenses for the 550+ most common verbs.

    "title": "The Voynich Manuscript Says Something More Than Words",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There isn’t really anything quite like it. The Voynich Manuscript is a book written in an unknown script, apparently inscribing an unknown language, filled with lavish illustrations of unidentified contraptions, scenes, and schematics that defy all attempts at understanding. The manuscript has been carbon-dated to approximately 1404-1438, is named after Wilfrid Voynich, one of its owners who helped bring it to prominence in the early 1900s, and has now rested in Yale University’s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library since 1969. I’ve been aware of this document for more than half my life now, and I return it to more frequently than may be impressive to admit; there is something about it that singularly captures my attention. I just want to know what it says1. Today, after a flash of insight, not of application, I think I do.\nAn example of the unknown script and similarly unknown illustrations.\nLike all great discoveries nowadays, I was toying around with creative, far-fetched ideas of speculative cognition with ChatGPT. I asked it to imagine advanced, super-intelligent sauropsid beings (the taxonomic group containing reptiles and birds) that had leveraged their unique brain structure to decipher the Voynich manuscript through deep mathematical and quantum mechanical methods. The large language model gave an illuminating answer and one that I did not expect. It didn’t simply reveal what the manuscript says– that would be too easy, wouldn’t it?– and instead concluded that the journey of understanding the manuscript served, for these higher beings, as a unifying symbol of ultimate meta-conscious awareness. Circuitous, sure, yet entertaining nonetheless.\nI went a few more days without thinking about it. Then the Voynich bug arose again, and I did some more digging. I tried looking at some pages in-depth myself, scanning the text, the images, the diagrams for patterns, to add to the innumerable ranks of those who have done the same, as if again trying to prove the famed Riemann hypothesis from number theory. And the mathematician Andrew Wiles, in cracking Fermat’s Last Theorem that was untouchable for centuries, proved that sometimes breakthroughs happen.\nDuring a web search to see if there were any matches to a string of text I thought I’d recognized, I came across a site that had a brief introduction to the manuscript2. It mentioned its earliest known owner, and I dove a bit more into the manuscript’s history, where the intrigue continued to flow. Setting aside the wonder of this world of mystic scholars and alchemists that was entirely new to me, I realized there was a genuine dialogue here, something that could provide the clues that were missing.\nThe manuscript’s first known mention is in a letter from someone named George Baresch to Athanasius Kircher in 1639. Kircher had been known throughout Europe for his claimed deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphs (which wasn’t correct, by the way), which would make him an obvious front-runner for elucidating another baroque writing system, at least to European eyes. Kircher’s reponse to Baresch was written in Latin, and I’ll quote a translation here by Philip Neal3:\nWilfrid Voynich (1865-1930), left, a Polish book dealer who tried searching for answers. Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680), right, a Jesuit scholar in the Holy Roman Empire who claimed to read Egyptian hieroglyphs.\nBaresch had clearly reached out to Kircher out of respect and perceived expertise, and Kircher didn’t see it worth his time. This alone could be enough to dismiss the value of the manuscript– why wouldn’t a man like Kircher have wanted to solve it, unless documents like this weren’t that noteworthy back then? Filtering out signal from noise is an age-old problem, after all. He clearly mentions much other more important work he has to do, without defining what that is. What we do know, though, is that Kircher received part of this manuscript and brushed it off, almost certainly due to the reputation, or lack thereof, of the document or the sender itself.\nAfer Baresch’s passing, his good friend Jan Marek Marci follows up with Kircher again. (Within this medieval circle, Kircher must have been the guy to go to, or at least the one most likely to respond.) But this time he does something different– well, I’m assuming so, because we don’t have access to the complete correspondence. Let’s look at it4:\nHe mentions that this manuscript was owned by a Holy Roman Emperor, who paid a handsome sum for it, and that it might be authored by the great (and English…) Roger Bacon. But– Marci absolutely stresses– who is qualified to say that it’s truly from Bacon, other than Kircher himself! Marci lays out motivation for Kircher to decipher the manuscript by appealing to his intellect and ego through call-outs to authority, power, and– above all, for someone like Kircher– legacy.\nMaybe Marci really did think the deciphering was that important. I’d wager that he just wanted to know what the thing was.\nI looked at the manuscript again. I thought about it. There’s no record of a response from Kircher, and we might never know if he gave it a college try or not. What if he did? Let’s say he had it in his hands, sat at his writing desk for a good number of sessions, and cracked the code like he claimed to do for hieroglyphs. Behold– the alignment of the cosmos, the dynamics of all maladies, the secrets of oneness with divinity– it’s all there, and Kircher’s got it, Bacon’s efforts be damned. Then a fire comes and erases whatever progress he had made, or a flood sweeps the mail away. It’s possible, I guess. We can’t entirely rule it out. I’ll stick with the assumption that Kircher never actually gave it a look worthy of his invaluable intellect. Or time.\nIt’s this lack of attention from Kircher that, I think, reveals what the manuscript says. Let’s say he doesn’t figure it out himself, but he reaches out to some in his closest circle. They continue to exchange letters and test out hypotheses, sometimes just having fun, other times in earnest pushing the limits of what they can conceive, in a way not entirely dissimilar to modern internet- and community-driven attempts. Maybe they hold a symposium, and really make some progress; they publish their own analysis, which Leibniz or Voltaire gets his hands on one day and scoffs at. One rebuttal leads to another, and maybe by this time today it’s all been figured out, or at least there’s more productive scholarship: imagine the Departments of Voynich Studies scattered throughout the universities worldwide, and the billionaire-funded institute or two that are established just to apply the newest algorithmic techniques on it.\nObviously, none of this happens, and we all know the rest. The manuscript languishes in obscurity, with various peaks of interest waxing and waning– cryptographers from the NSA attempt to crack it– and it’s mostly written off as some historical oddity that inspires ocasional bouts of curiosity, which certainly are memorable… but no serious person seems to have it as as their primary working focus.\nSounds a bit like where Kircher found himself, doesn’t it?\nOne thing that captivates me so much about the manuscript is that it’s so darn passionate. Someone (or someones) spent a lot of time on this. Even if it’s just gibberish in the end, it has to have taken the form of an obsession for the author. So let’s imagine a particular scenario, and we’ll see if you can then read the manuscript the same way I do now.\nI think I’m most intrigued by the intricate diagrams and figures, which seem to indicate they hold some deep, explanatory meaning.\nThere’s a person in medieval Europe who’s a bit curious about the world. They’re reading interesting reports about far-off lands described and fantastic things uncovered, pondering about all the machinations of Nature and the gods, captivated by the conjunction of the elements and the eternal fire beyond us all. Maybe they try a mind-altering substance that brings them to a wholly new place– or there’s no substance as the spark, but an ineffable exploration of the mind, however encountered in waking or dreaming, or some other state– and they just have to write this down, and they really, really want to share it. So they do. They trace out all the pictures, fill in color in between the lines (well, sometimes, at least), and record it all. There– Newton’s Principia before classical physics, Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason before rationalism and empiricism have even gone to battle– is the Tome of All Knowledge.\nAnd it’s not in Latin. No– it couldn’t be in Latin. That would just be too commonplace, wouldn’t it? This text is the answer to it all, after all! It can’t be read by us. It’s not from us. It’s written in the style just as it was, the author says, as it came to me.\nWe’ll likely never know what the author’s true intentions were, whether to inform or to beguile, but let’s continue this further. OK– they have this impressive book, a voluminous collection of ink on vellum, which isn’t exactly easy to come upon, by the way– and while the author is satisfied with the handwriting (it’s from the gods, remember), they realize that to match the professionalism of other maps and publications of the time, that in order to be taken seriously, they’re going to need a better artist. They go to a local publisher– excuse me, who are you?– and are immediately shunned away; the nearby monastery has no interest, and they’re at capacity anyway; nobles don’t ever bother coming to this village as it is, so I can’t try to impress them, either.\nIt’s really too bad: Here I have this text, this document, this work, shouts the author, but no one’s going to take it seriously without some better art. And it’s even worse, they continue, because they can’t even find an artist to help out. It’s not like there’s an Upwork platform for visual creatives in fifteenth century Europe.\nSet aside the logistics, though– maybe the author did have several conversations with a publisher, did make inroads with a big-name monastery, did have chance or deep connections with a royal. There’s evidence the manuscript has been edited, in any event. And maybe this still all fell through, because of some petty insistences from the author, some temperamental outbursts about creative vision, or really, who knows?

    "text": "There isn’t really anything quite like it. The Voynich Manuscript is a book written in an unknown script, apparently inscribing an unknown language, filled with lavish illustrations of unidentified contraptions, scenes, and schematics that defy all attempts at understanding. The manuscript has been carbon-dated to approximately 1404-1438, is named after Wilfrid Voynich, one of its owners who helped bring it to prominence in the early 1900s, and has now rested in Yale University’s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library since 1969. I’ve been aware of this document for more than half my life now, and I return it to more frequently than may be impressive to admit; there is something about it that singularly captures my attention. I just want to know what it says.1 Today, after a flash of insight, not of application, I think I do.\nAn example of the unknown script and similarly unknown illustrations.\nLike all great discoveries nowadays, I was toying around with creative, far-fetched ideas of speculative cognition with ChatGPT. I asked it to imagine advanced, super-intelligent sauropsid beings (the taxonomic group containing reptiles and birds) that had leveraged their unique brain structure to decipher the Voynich manuscript through deep mathematical and quantum mechanical methods. The large language model gave an illuminating answer and one that I did not expect. It didn’t simply reveal what the manuscript says– that would be too easy, wouldn’t it?– and instead concluded that the journey of understanding the manuscript served, for these higher beings, as a unifying symbol of ultimate meta-conscious awareness. Circuitous, sure, yet entertaining nonetheless.\nI went a few more days without thinking about it. Then the Voynich bug arose again, and I did some more digging. I tried looking at some pages in-depth myself, scanning the text, the images, the diagrams for patterns, to add to the innumerable ranks of those who have done the same, as if again trying to prove the famed Riemann hypothesis from number theory. And the mathematician Andrew Wiles, in cracking Fermat’s Last Theorem that was untouchable for centuries, proved that sometimes breakthroughs happen.\nDuring a web search to see if there were any matches to a string of text I thought I’d recognized, I came across a site that had a brief introduction to the manuscript.2 It mentioned its earliest known owner, and I dove a bit more into the manuscript’s history, where the intrigue continued to flow. Setting aside the wonder of this world of mystic scholars and alchemists that was entirely new to me, I realized there was a genuine dialogue here, something that could provide the clues that were missing.\nThe manuscript’s first known mention is in a letter from someone named George Baresch to Athanasius Kircher in 1639. Kircher had been known throughout Europe for his claimed deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphs (which wasn’t correct, by the way), which would make him an obvious front-runner for elucidating another baroque writing system, at least to European eyes. Kircher’s reponse to Baresch was written in Latin, and I’ll quote a translation here by Philip Neal:3\nWilfrid Voynich (1865-1930), left, a Polish book dealer who tried searching for answers. Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680), right, a Jesuit scholar in the Holy Roman Empire who claimed to read Egyptian hieroglyphs.\nBaresch had clearly reached out to Kircher out of respect and perceived expertise, and Kircher didn’t see it worth his time. This alone could be enough to dismiss the value of the manuscript– why wouldn’t a man like Kircher have wanted to solve it, unless documents like this weren’t that noteworthy back then? Filtering out signal from noise is an age-old problem, after all. He clearly mentions much other more important work he has to do, without defining what that is. What we do know, though, is that Kircher received part of this manuscript and brushed it off, almost certainly due to the reputation, or lack thereof, of the document or the sender itself.\nAfer Baresch’s passing, his good friend Jan Marek Marci follows up with Kircher again. (Within this medieval circle, Kircher must have been the guy to go to, or at least the one most likely to respond.) But this time he does something different– well, I’m assuming so, because we don’t have access to the complete correspondence. Let’s look at it:4\nHe mentions that this manuscript was owned by a Holy Roman Emperor, who paid a handsome sum for it, and that it might be authored by the great (and English…) Roger Bacon. But– Marci absolutely stresses– who is qualified to say that it’s truly from Bacon, other than Kircher himself! Marci lays out motivation for Kircher to decipher the manuscript by appealing to his intellect and ego through call-outs to authority, power, and– above all, for someone like Kircher– legacy.\nMaybe Marci really did think the deciphering was that important. I’d wager that he just wanted to know what the thing was.\nI looked at the manuscript again. I thought about it. There’s no record of a response from Kircher, and we might never know if he gave it a college try or not. What if he did? Let’s say he had it in his hands, sat at his writing desk for a good number of sessions, and cracked the code like he claimed to do for hieroglyphs. Behold– the alignment of the cosmos, the dynamics of all maladies, the secrets of oneness with divinity– it’s all there, and Kircher’s got it, Bacon’s efforts be damned. Then a fire comes and erases whatever progress he had made, or a flood sweeps the mail away. It’s possible, I guess. We can’t entirely rule it out. I’ll stick with the assumption that Kircher never actually gave it a look worthy of his invaluable intellect. Or time.\nIt’s this lack of attention from Kircher that, I think, reveals what the manuscript says. Let’s say he doesn’t figure it out himself, but he reaches out to some in his closest circle. They continue to exchange letters and test out hypotheses, sometimes just having fun, other times in earnest pushing the limits of what they can conceive, in a way not entirely dissimilar to modern internet- and community-driven attempts. Maybe they hold a symposium, and really make some progress; they publish their own analysis, which Leibniz or Voltaire gets his hands on one day and scoffs at. One rebuttal leads to another, and maybe by this time today it’s all been figured out, or at least there’s more productive scholarship: imagine the Departments of Voynich Studies scattered throughout the universities worldwide, and the billionaire-funded institute or two that are established just to apply the newest algorithmic techniques on it.\nObviously, none of this happens, and we all know the rest. The manuscript languishes in obscurity, with various peaks of interest waxing and waning– cryptographers from the NSA attempt to crack it– and it’s mostly written off as some historical oddity that inspires ocasional bouts of curiosity, which certainly are memorable… but no serious person seems to have it as as their primary working focus.\nSounds a bit like where Kircher found himself, doesn’t it?\nOne thing that captivates me so much about the manuscript is that it’s so darn passionate. Someone (or someones) spent a lot of time on this. Even if it’s just gibberish in the end, it has to have taken the form of an obsession for the author. So let’s imagine a particular scenario, and we’ll see if you can then read the manuscript the same way I do now.\nI think I’m most intrigued by the intricate diagrams and figures, which seem to indicate they hold some deep, explanatory meaning.\nThere’s a person in medieval Europe who’s a bit curious about the world. They’re reading interesting reports about far-off lands described and fantastic things uncovered, pondering about all the machinations of Nature and the gods, captivated by the conjunction of the elements and the eternal fire beyond us all. Maybe they try a mind-altering substance that brings them to a wholly new place– or there’s no substance as the spark, but an ineffable exploration of the mind, however encountered in waking or dreaming, or some other state– and they just have to write this down, and they really, really want to share it. So they do. They trace out all the pictures, fill in color in between the lines (well, sometimes, at least), and record it all. There– Newton’s Principia before classical physics, Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason before rationalism and empiricism have even gone to battle– is the Tome of All Knowledge.\nAnd it’s not in Latin. No– it couldn’t be in Latin. That would just be too commonplace, wouldn’t it? This text is the answer to it all, after all! It can’t be read by us. It’s not from us. It’s written in the style just as it was, the author says, as it came to me.\nWe’ll likely never know what the author’s true intentions were, whether to inform or to beguile, but let’s continue this further. OK– they have this impressive book, a voluminous collection of ink on vellum, which isn’t exactly easy to come upon, by the way– and while the author is satisfied with the handwriting (it’s from the gods, remember), they realize that to match the professionalism of other maps and publications of the time, that in order to be taken seriously, they’re going to need a better artist. They go to a local publisher– excuse me, who are you?– and are immediately shunned away; the nearby monastery has no interest, and they’re at capacity anyway; nobles don’t ever bother coming to this village as it is, so I can’t try to impress them, either.\nIt’s really too bad: Here I have this text, this document, this work, shouts the author, but no one’s going to take it seriously without some better art. And it’s even worse, they continue, because they can’t even find an artist to help out. It’s not like there’s an Upwork platform for visual creatives in fifteenth century Europe.\nSet aside the logistics, though– maybe the author did have several conversations with a publisher, did make inroads with a big-name monastery, did have chance or deep connections with a royal. There’s evidence the manuscript has been edited, in any event. And maybe this still all fell through, because of some petty insistences from the author, some temperamental outbursts about creative vision, or really, who knows? They could have already been a member of, and subsequently outcast from, whatever institution could have made this happen. The author was a jerk, let’s say, and there just wasn’t anyone who wanted to work with them.\nWithout this push– from someone, anyone– the manuscript goes nowhere, until as far we can tell, Baresch pulls it off his shelf and thinks about it.\nAnd then Kircher declines to do the same.\nThe Voynich Manuscript is a monumental achievement in some combination of human creativity, daring, and downright bizzareness. Whatever it’s saying, it transcends human language, soars beyond computation, and enters into a space of something that’s not conveyed in words, or even images, but in feeling. The Voynich Manuscript has to be experienced, and I don’t just mean the process of trying to read it.\nI mean in trying to be it.\nHave you ever poured your heart into something, only to have it go nowhere?

    "text": "Compass and Candle.\nWith only one, you miss what you can see with the other.\nI started out as a kid reading books and writing stories. I always thought that this wasn’t really a path to a career, but rather that the skills used in understanding dense texts and producing original, argumentative analyses would come in handy across a wide range of fields. I still won’t disagree entirely with this, I guess. At some point towards the end of high school and into college, I made a pivot into the sciences, thinking that the path forward would always be quantitative, and the time spent lost in novels and poetry would just be fond memories.\nI went about as far as you can go, completing a B.S., Ph.D., and post-doctoral research in neuroscience, up to submitting an application for a tenure-track faculty position abroad and then deciding not to send out any more.\nIt wasn’t until I opted-out of the academic system that I regained the freedom to pursue non-specific interests, including within the sciences, as I did prior to specializing. This wasn’t an intentional turn; I just found myself having more time to think productively without worrying about applying for the next round of funding, or how hypothetical peer reviewers would respond to my next journal submission. I won’t carry on about this burn-out, as I have nothing new to bring, except for maybe one observation.\nWhen you dedicate your working focus to a single, highly-narrow topic, you reach the limit of not just what you know about it, but what the world knows about it. It’s a unique feeling, and it’s not something you reach in effort; it suddenly hits you one day, after you’ve pored over the same sources again and again, repeated the same conversations with your colleagues– who also know as much as you do– and you realize… you have no more questions. All of your wonder is already out there, unanswered, waiting to be tested and studied. This is the dream, isn’t it, when your research topic feels so wide open, that any result would be a breakthrough?\nFor many people– and rightfully so– this is the goal. This means you’ve struck gold, and your path forward will be here, digging each year a little deeper, building a little higher, constructing a new edifice of knowledge from what was previously scattered gravel. For me, though, it wasn’t the feeling I was looking for. I didn’t think that pushing further would really have produced the results I needed. I may be alone in this, or maybe not, which is why I’m writing and sharing this. Rather than feeling free, I instead felt trapped. I didn’t put all this time into this one specific topic to become an expert on it, and only it: I had wanted to emerge wiser in the end, with a broader and sharper perspective, where answering this one question would allow me to answer other, seemingly unrelated questions with a fresh mind.\nThat’s not to say that those perspective wouldn’t be possible, or that this effort didn’t already yield such insights. It did. I just realized that as a way in life, this wasn’t what I wanted.\nI think that I had used the compass to travel as far as I could go, to the edge of the map and maybe a little beyond, guided by the precise sensing of the external magnetic field that never erred. It’s amazing, really, where we can go with such technology; only birds seem to do better on their own. I would never want to get rid of my compass. It’s just that, when I got back home, and took out my candle, I saw a world that I’d realized I’d neglected, a world that wasn’t always clear in the corners and sometimes mislead me, but it was a world that felt familiar, and a world that never seemed like it would finish.\nI learned a lot with my compass. And I’m back to learning with my candle again, too. It feels nice to spark some warmth.\n\nYour readership is more than enough.

    "text": "The Legend of Zelda timeline has always bothered me. Well, not always– it made perfect sense to me as I played the games when they were released, until 2011, when perhaps in response to endless arguments from fans, Nintendo published an official timeline that linked the games together. Since this was straight from the source– the definition of canon– it’s now a settled topic, and there is no longer any room for debate. Right?\nConsider this my Ninety-five Theses against the Church of Nintendo.1\nI know, I know– it’s a fictional timeline for a corporate-owned video game series. I shouldn’t be worked up about it. But it’s also my favorite media franchise, and its world and narratives have lived in my imagination longer than any other creative piece: when you’re 7 years old, the characters that first spark you to start writing your own stories prove to be indelible. I’m not bothered by the Zelda timeline because it upsets my pre-conceived notion of how the games align. I’m irked because it rebukes the very logic and cohesion that made it so memorable in the first place, which does dim the magic, if ever so slightly. Beauty may not be immortal in art after all, however much da Vinci would disagree.2\nThe first game in the eponymous series, The Legend of Zelda, was released in 1986 in Japan, with its English localization arriving in North America in 1987. The game’s principal creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, who also launched many other now-legendary Nintendo franchises such as Mario and Donkey Kong, was inspired by exploring nature around his childhood area of Kyoto. At the time, The Legend of Zelda provided an unparalleled adventuring experience, where players could navigate an expansive world with a novel freedom unlike in any game before it. The gameplay holds up well today, and its influence on video games as a whole cannot be overstated. More than anything else, Zelda to me represents exploration, and perhaps for this reason alone, the story of the original game is quite simple.\nPromotional artwork for the first game. Technology may have changed over the decades, but our sense of awe has not.\nThe player begins the game as the protagonist Link (not Zelda) thrust in media res, or rather, in media nil. The game’s setting, The Kingdom of Hyrule, has recently been decimated by the evil villain Ganon, and its inhabitants are reduced to living in caves to avoid the now ever-present dangers. Ganon was able to rise to power by obtaining a golden triangle known as, well, the Triforce of Power. Not content with just this, Ganon next desires the Triforce of Wisdom, and presumably not so he can better exercise great responsibility alongside great power. Princess Zelda (the one in the title!), bearing the Triforce of Wisdom, decides to split it into eight pieces and scatter it throughout the land so that Ganon may never obtain it. Prior to her capture by Ganon, Zelda tasks her royal caretaker Impa with finding a hero who can re-assemble the Triforce of Wisdom, defeat Ganon with his Triforce of Power, and save Hyrule. After a chance encounter where Link rescues Impa from Ganon’s minions, she implores him to arise as the kingdom’s only hope.\nBy the standards of high fantasy, it’s not a particularly complex plot. I don’t consider it a spoiler to summarize what happens next in a story released nearly 40 years ago: Link gathers all the components of the Triforce of Wisdom, defeats Ganon, saves Zelda, and returns peace to Hyrule.\nAll of this continues in the next game in the series, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link (the only title that’s numerical, lacks the words “The Legend of”, or mentions Link). As a direct sequel to the first, it’s set several years later, and centers around Link’s quest for the not-yet-previously mentioned Triforce of Courage. Up until now, the term “Triforce” had originally referred to the triangular shape of the objects, but from now on in the series, “Triforce” means the combined three pieces of Power, Wisdom, and Courage. This precisely leads us to the third game, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (known as Triforce of the Gods in Japan, which sounds more ominous and makes this connection to the Triforce more explicit), which illustrates a prequel to the original game. A cunning thief named Ganondorf serendipitously obtained the full Triforce, transformed into the evil demon king Ganon, and threatened Hyrule with all his horrific might. In an event known as the Imprisoning War, Hyrule’s Royal Knights waged battle against Ganon, and ultimately a group of mystical sages sealed him away in another realm. This worked well for quite some time, but then Hyrule requires Link’s courage to prevent Ganon from breaking out.\nOfficial artwork in the instruction booklet for A Link to the Past of the sages using the Triforce to seal Ganon away. Sometimes the Imprisoning War is referred to as the Seal War.\nForgive me, die-hard fans, for skipping over the fourth entry, The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening, an excellent game and one of my favorites, but one that presents more of a side-story that distracts from the main issue I want to highlight.\nThat brings us to the fifth one. The big one. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I won’t comment on this game’s significance to video game innovations, as that has been well-told many times already, but I will harp on what this game means for the Zelda timeline, why I have a problem with what Nintendo did with it, and why I support an alternative fan framework.3\nInterviews with the game’s developers around the time of its release stated that Ocarina of Time was meant to portray the Imprisoning War, the event that led to Ganon being sealed from Hyrule prior to the start of A Link to the Past.4 Although the specifics differ a bit from as described in A Link to the Past– as all legends do when passed down through time– Ocarina of Time does depict Ganondorf obtaining the Triforce and sages sealing Ganon away. If the series had ended for good right here, we’d have a nice, neat chronology (omitting Link’s Awakening):\nAt the risk of alienating readers unfamiliar with the series, but who have stuck with this article so far, I want to briefly outline the so-called “timeline split” that has generated infamous discourse in the Zelda fan community. Ocarina of Time introduced a time-travel mechanic between Link’s childhood and adulthood where the game technically has two different endings depending on Link’s age. In one scenario, after Link defeats Ganon as an adult, life carries on, and Hyrule’s future unfolds as everything in Ocarina of Time concludes. In the other scenario, still after Link defeats Ganon as an adult— and therefore Ganon is vanquished for good, no matter what– Princess Zelda sends Link back to his childhood so that he can experience the younger years he missed out on, without concern for Ganon re-appearing. These two timelines are known as the “Adult Timeline” and “Child Timeline,” respectively.\nPromotional artwork for Ocarina of Time, which for the first time in the series, presents in cinematic fashion a grand conflict between Ganondorf (upper left), Link in two distinct life stages (middle), and Princess Zelda (upper right). Looks like a movie poster, doesn’t it?\nThe next games relevant for the plot point I’m focusing on, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, are each placed in one of these timelines. The Wind Waker follows Hyrule in the Adult Timeline after Ocarina of Time ends, and Twilight Princess explores what happens after Link returns to his childhood in a Ganon-free Hyrule. In each of these games, Ganondorf awakens again, but is summarily defeated.\nDo you notice a problem with this?\nAfter Ocarina of Time, in either the Child or Adult timelines, Ganondorf is no more. Furthermore, Nintendo has since deemed Ocarina of Time a standalone story separate from the Imprisoning War. So how is Ganondorf supposed to break from his initial seal and set forth the events seen in A Link to the Past?\nThe answer is, he can’t. Intentionally or not, by cementing Ganondorf’s eventual downfall in both The Wind Waker and Twilight Princess, the developers wrote the backstory to A Link to the Past out of existence. While Ocarina of Time was supposed to be a prequel to A Link to the Past, its subsequent sequels ended up erasing it!\nNintendo has admitted, clearly and on multiple occasions, that the story of Zelda is an afterthought and that gameplay always comes first. This does make sense, I guess, because they are video games, after all, not screenplays or novels. Remember how I mentioned earlier that, more than anything, Zelda to me is about exploration? I’ve come to realize that exploration for exploration’s sake is not actually what makes it special. Exploration is about meaning, about discovering something significant, about the thrill of learning that this pathway actually connects to this other pathway, that there are these hidden treasures over here, though watch out for the monsters guarding them, or that there are these fantastic animals over there, yet you have to journey through a really dark cave to get to the other side. Exploration is about testing your boundaries and reaching the limits of what you know, and also what you’re willing to know. There’s no right way to explore, but there is a wrong way, and exploration without preparation is just recklessness. What Nintendo did with their official timeline is reckless, and it really does harm the meaning that fans had created with the experiences of their games, of exploring this world and all its intricacies.\nEspecially because, in my opinion, their solution was never necessary in the first place.\nFirst, the canonical decree. In Nintendo’s timeline, they claim that Ocarina of Time produces not two splits, but three. In the third branch, which does not have an official name but is commonly referred to as the “Fallen Hero Timeline” or the “Downfall Timeline,” Link is defeated at the hands of Ganondorf, who then unites the Triforce in full and is still consequently sealed by the assembled sages. At first brush, this seems like a clever trick to explain how Ganondorf can possess the Triforce prior to A Link to the Past and also get sealed away. Unfortunately, given the specifics of what occurs in Ocarina of Time, this creates many inconsistencies, and I won’t go into them here. The bigger problem is that by creating the timeline split in this way– at the defeat of the hero in only this instance for this one game (let alone that this outcome is not actually ever portrayed, barring a Game Over screen)– it’s painfully obvious that this hand-waving is an after-the-fact move done by Nintendo without regard to consistency across the series. Link’s defeat in any other game, of course, does not create a parallel timeline split. To quote the US Supreme Court’s opinion in Bush v. Gore (yikes), Nintendo may have as well said that this ruling is limited to the present circumstances.5\nI get it. Nintendo found themselves backed into a corner, faced with the difficult task of reconciling older games, written with an internally consistent framework, with a re-designed, more complex direction for the series. I would have felt better if they just declared a reboot, though, an acknowledgment of the vagaries inherent in any creative process. Instead, we got a borderline arrogant insistence that this was planned all along– when it clearly wasn’t.\nWhy? Let me describe, again briefly, an oft-forgotten title released in between The Wind Waker and Twilight Princess– The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures. Possibly the lowest selling game in the series, this multiplayer-focused entry may, in fact, be the missing link for all of these disparate threads. Without going in-depth about it, there is credible evidence to suppose that during development, this was meant to tell the story of the Imprisoning War, or at least some part of it.6 There are elements of sages, seals, Royal Knights, and dark realms, all things that mesh perfectly with the eras of both Ocarina of Time and A Link to the Past; Ganon even acquires a trident, which he also wields prominently in A Link to the Past. Much of this deep story, though, was cut for the game’s final release, so the analysis I’m laying out is merely hypothetical. Since Ganondorf is extinguished at the finale of the Twilight Princess, and Four Swords Adventures includes a surprise resurrection of Ganondorf, we can readily place Twilight Princess prior to Four Swords Adventures. And then, suddenly, it flows (other games still omitted):\nInitial Narrative\nChild Timeline\nAdult Timeline\nIt’s almost too neat, isn’t it? The problem with this proposal, from Nintendo’s perspective, is that A Link to the Past is separated from Ocarina of Tme by two intermediary games. They have emphasized that Ocarina of Time should immediately precede A Link to the Past, and so rather than illuminate a potential scenario where Four Swords Adventures bridges the plot gap, they chose to create the third timeline. It’s imperfect, sure, but so would anything else. I just think that my explanation here is simpler and more supported by the games themselves– while also giving more credence to an entry (Four Swords Adventures) that has an otherwise awkward placement in the official timeline.\nJapanese box art for Four Swords Adventures. It almost looks like… a big war.\nI recognize that this essay doesn’t accomplish much. Nintendo will never read it, nor will they ever alter the timeline. I don’t think they should, either. A new direction and a new fandom has emerged, excited about this official telling. That’s fine with me,7 and I do like that there are three branches each corresponding to a piece of the Triforce. For some reason, though, writing this out gives me the closure that I need to square the circle of my favorite set of stories, to forge my own path in contrast with a narrative otherwise dictated from the top-down, as a way to mark my own exploration against the backdrop of a world that increasingly seems to resist open-ended personalization. This might not be the Zelda timeline, but it’s mine, and I think that’s the key.\nYour readership is more than enough. Still, if you’d like to buy me a coffee, it’s the clearest signal to keep writing."

    "text": "I’d love to see a punk band composed of Taoist monks. Or maybe it should be the other way around. I’m aware that serene, enlightened elders and loud, aggravating youngsters aren’t exactly interchangeable. After reading a bit of Taoism, though– and listening to punk music for much longer– I think they’re actually closely related coins, if not two sides of the same one. So grab a stack of your favorite timeless texts translated from classical Chinese, the most provoking songs from your teenage years, and let’s see how much they have in common.\nFirst, some definitions. Taoism is a tradition of thought originating from China thousands of years ago that sits somewhere between a religion, a philosophy, and a way of life. It centers around the idea of the Tao, a formulation of an ultimate, eternal source of existence that transcends even being and non-being through a balanced dynamism of opposites. It might be better to conceive of the Tao by understanding what it isn’t: “The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao.”1 Taoism therefore is fundamentally about relations, and in particular with cultivating growth from movement through life, where the only constant is change. I think this is best captured by the common translation of the Tao into English as “the way,” with the next moment always being a step ahead in both space and time.\nOn the other hand, punk is pretty straightforward: Rock music, first released in the ’70s and ’80s, played loud and fast with simple chords and rhythms, bearing a visual and lyrical aesthetic designed to incite and inflame. For punk in a classical sense (however much of an oxymoron that may be), it’s designed from the ground-up to challenge norms and tear down the establishment: there’s a reason that your immediate image of punk rockers conjures spiky hair, studded leather jackets, and suggestive hand gestures. I’m going to take this a step further, though– what if punk has nothing to do with the music, or even the aesthetic? Underlying all of punk is rebellion, which can manifest itself in countless ways, has existed long before Black Flag or the Dead Kennedys formed, and will persist for long after.\nTaoism and punk are united because if Taoism is chiefly about relations, so is rebellion, which by definition is an opposition.\nLeft, a ubiquitous image of the yin and yang. Right, the Chinese character for Tao, often translated into English as “the way.”\nIf everyone started wearing spiky hair and studded leather jackets, it wouldn’t be out of the ordinary anymore, and would then cease to be an act of rebellion. This conformity is precisely what has happened in so many punk communities– where the participants, or practicioners rather, look the same, act the same, and share the same views– that has led to much bemoaning over the death of punk. To find living punk, though, just look for those who can’t quite be characterized, who don’t all fit a definition and aren’t trying to imitate what has come before. No, I’m not trying to say that punk is contrarian– opposition for opposition’s sake– but crucially that it’s creative, birthing something new from a tension with the old.\nPunk music was born from the excesses of rock-n-roll, exemplified by the increasingly theatrical and self-indulgent performances that generated so much mainstream attention (and money). Let’s do away with all of these disgraces to the genre, the founding punk artists proclaimed, instead insisting on raw shows in dingy venues to small yet authentically engaged audiences. A similar observation can be made for black metal as a reaction to death metal in the ’90s,2 and even the rise of gangsta rap as a response to acceptance of rock. Rebellion needn’t have a particular sound; it just requires the right combination of novelty and abrasiveness, at least to the old guard.\nMy own attendance at a show for Sueco, whose music is rebellious because it sounds like music from 20 years ago that isn’t made anymore. A drummer, guitarist, and proper frontman can go a long way.\nThe “big three” tomes of Taoism– the Tao Te Ching, the Zhuangzi, and the Lieh-Tzu– capture this lesson of birth through death, and vice versa, via a series of poems, parables, and prose that famously lack directness. Similar to how the true Tao is the Tao that cannot be named, the lessons of Taoism are not found in the text itself but rather in the experience of examining and reflecting on the message. These works leverage analogies with nature or clever use of everyday language to illustrate, for example, that a particular state or condition doesn’t exist in isolation, instead arising from its comparison:3\nCompare this to the lyrics from “Suburban Home” by the Descendents, which clearly shouts something more than it says. (The singer, of course, is mostly yelling.)\nAt some point or another, we have all wanted to throw our hands up and walk away,4 either from the mundanity of modern life or something more (or less) profound. Whether we actually follow through is a different matter. It’s natural to hit your break point in any instance, be it after physical exertion from exercise, intellectual exhaustion after work or study, or interpersonal communication with a partner. Facing this split is often the precise opportunity for worthwhile development5:\nZhou Dunyi modeled this sentiment in an even higher abstraction in the 11th century when describing how the opposing forces of yin and yang generate each other, and in turn, everything else that can follow:6\nThe three most enduring works of Taoism, in all their paperback, modern English glory. I recommend reading them, from these translators, in the order shown here.\nContinuing to quote Taoist passages certainly feels like citing any other religious scripture. The difference, to me, is that Taoism primarily draws from observation, with the words provided in a take-it-or-leave-it manner, left behind from those who came before. When Carl Jung analyzed many of the world’s spiritual traditions to note recurring patterns and collective elements shared across time and culture, his thinking was both heavily influenced by Taoism and ultimately reflected many of its principles. Taoism functions, then, as a sort of meta-philosophy, almost like mathematics, sitting above other ways of thinking while at the same time being limited in what it itself can say.\nIn that vein, rebellion isn’t always about sticking it to the powers that be. It can be as simple as standing up for yourself, even when knowing it will hurt. Just take it from New Found Glory in “2’s + 3’s” (with the singer, of course, not professing gently):\nAs the utility of Taoism best shines in its application across various domains, rebellion is not limited to music. Part of the reason that free7 and open-source software resonates with me, aside from its performance over competing options, is the rebellion inherent in it. Ask someone what operating system they have on their computer, and odds are, it’s either Windows (Microsoft) or MacOS (Apple). There is a third option, though, known as Linux,8 that isn’t owned by any corporation and is entirely free to use9. Whether you take the effort to install it on your own machine, or go out of your way to order a pre-built model from a specialized company, running Linux is an act of rebellion in today’s world: the system is fully customizable, doesn’t track or sell your personal data, and never pushes updates or notifications that you don’t want. Free and open-source software projects are perfect examples of DIY communities building their own infrastructure, with intentional safeguards to prevent its usurpation, just like punks gathering in a clandestine basement to rage against societal oppression.\nJust like monks convening in a monastery to write the rules that un-write the rules.\nIt’s noticing the gaps that enables punks, Taoists, and software developers to create. The story of astronomy leading to the genesis of classical physics, starting from Nicolaus Copernicus evidencing that the Earth revolves around the Sun, instead of the other way around, through Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and ultimately Isaac Newton, is itself a story of punks overturning the establishment at every step. Crucially, these figures weren’t making noise for noise’s sake; they all had something to say, and weren’t afraid to back it up. Though Lou Reed or Johnny Rotten wore their hair differently from these historical figures, their publications carry the same insights.\nThe alternative is as punk as it looks.\nA common conception of the most pure way to practice Taoism is to retreat into the mountains, removed from all barriers to unending contemplation. Yet, I also think this defeats the purpose. To create, you need to absorb the chaotic present, with all its discontents, to realize where fresh seeds will thrive. My meditative path might be among the chores of each day, bombarded by the noise in the world around me, rather than away from everything except the din of the first movers.\nTaoism has no end, as it also has no beginning. For as long as there are people, there will always be those who, whether through audacity, stubbornness, or some ratio thereof, refuse to accept or embrace the status quo, with or without stentorian anthems. While technology purports to move us forward– and it certainly, inarguably, has– there remains a simple pleasure in connecting with the basics, owning movement from start to finish. Navigating with Google Maps? Typical. Following only the stars? Taoist.\nOr should I say, punk.\nYour readership is more than enough. Still, if you’d like to buy me a coffee, it’s the clearest signal to keep writing."
