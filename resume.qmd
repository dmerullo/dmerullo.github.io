*Nationally-leading academic medical center with 500+ million dollars in annual research funding*
  
- First to perform single-cell RNA sequencing in songbirds, from molecular to computational components
  - Examined expression levels for 20,000 genes in 200,000+ individual cells across multiple brain regions, species, and cell types
  - Analyses included clustering (UMAP/tSNE), principal components analysis, tree-based models, differential expression tests, and linear regression
- Published co-first-author paper in Science (130+ citations), a second-author paper in Nature Communications (25+ citations), and a co-authored review article with 300+ citations
- Received a competitive NIH Postdoctoral Fellowship (NRSA F32)

### Education

***

**2018** Ph.D., Zoology \
University of Wisconsin-Madison (Madison, WI, USA)

**2013** B.S., Biopsychology (*cum laude*) \
Tufts University (Medford, MA, USA)

### Independent Projects

***

**Project ESPAÑOL** [(https://github.com/dmerullo/project-espanol)](https://github.com/dmerullo/project-espanol){target="_blank"} \
*Application that leverages high-throughput analysis of classical Spanish-language poems to create custom lesson plans and guide discovery of new texts for practice and study*

  - Used the R package `rvest` to scrape 10,000 Spanish-language poems in the public domain from 200 authors across 500 years, totaling 2.5 million words
  - Performed an unsupervised clustering analysis in Python to group the poems into 4 difficulty levels by analyzing the frequencies of 10,000+ verb forms conjugated across 18 grammatical tenses for the 550+ most common verbs
  - Created a Plotly Dash application for exploring the full texts, metadata, and grammatical statistics
  
### Selected Publications (600+ citations total)
