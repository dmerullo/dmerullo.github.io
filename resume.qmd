### Employment

***

**Senior Scientist Bioinformatics, Biomarkers & Genomic Medicine** (Jan. 2022--Present) \
*Parexel International (Remote from Dallas, TX, USA)* 

- Perform ETL for external data into an internal database for a major pharmaceutical client
- Ingest hundreds of datasets at the scale of thousands of files and terabytes in size, driving novel biomarker discovery for drug development
- Develop data ingestion pipelines combining technical computing with subject matter expertise
  - Created a bioinformatics engineering tool that was accepted for poster presentation at the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG)
- Define and conduct quality control of raw data and metadata

**Postdoctoral Researcher, Department of Neuroscience** (Jun. 2018--Jan. 2022) \
*University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (Hybrid from Dallas, TX, USA)*
  
- First to perform single-cell RNA sequencing in songbirds, from molecular to computational components
  - Examined expression levels for 20,000 genes in 200,000+ individual cells across multiple brain regions, species, and cell types
  - Analyses included clustering (UMAP/tSNE), principal components analysis, tree-based models, differential expression tests, and linear regression
  - Created custom visualizations with ggplot2 for publication and presentation
- Published co-first-author paper in Science (130+ citations), a second-author paper in Nature Communications (25+ citations), and a co-authored review article with 300+ citations
- Received a competitive NIH Postdoctoral Fellowship (NRSA F32)


### Education

***

**2018** Ph.D., Zoology \
University of Wisconsin-Madison (Madison, WI, USA)

**2013** B.S., Biopsychology (*cum laude*) \
Tufts University (Medford, MA, USA)

### External Projects

***

- Project ESPAÑOL: An Exploration Of Spanish-language Poetry And Nuances Of Language
  - A method to develop custom learning plans for Spanish lessons by leveraging high-throughput analysis of Spanish-language poems in the public domain
  - Used the R package `rvest` to scrape 10,000 classical poems from 200 authors covering 500 years, totaling 2.5 million words
  - For example, sequencing and clustering analyses in Python of 10,500+ verb forms (for the 550+ most common verbs conjugated across 19 grammatical tenses) classifies poems by difficulty and guides targeted discovery for practice and testing
  - Created a Plotly Dash application for exploring the dataset with interactive visualizations
