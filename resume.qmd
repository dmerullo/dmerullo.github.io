### Employment

***

**Senior Scientist Bioinformatics** (Jan. 2022--Present) \
**Parexel International** (Remote from Dallas, TX, USA) \
*Global clinical research organization with 20,000+ employees worldwide*

- Created novel data ingestion pipelines in R, Python, and Bash for a major pharmaceutical client (GSK) to reduce latency of data delivery by 10x
- Delivered thousands of genomic datasets (GWAS & xQTL) scaling to terabytes in size, driving biomarker discovery for drug development across the bioinformatics and data engineering teams
- Conducted high-throughput quality control of raw data and metadata for client turnaround in <24 hours

**Postdoctoral Researcher** (Jun. 2018--Jan. 2022) \
**University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center** (Hybrid from Dallas, TX, USA) \
*Nationally-leading academic medical center with $500 million+ annual funding*
  
- First to publish single-cell RNA sequencing in songbirds, by leading a collaboration across multiple groups with distinct expertise
  - Analyzed expression levels for 20,000 genes in 200,000+ individual cells covering multiple brain regions, species, and experiments
  - Techniques included clustering (UMAP/tSNE), principal components analysis, tree-based models, differential expression tests, and linear regression
- Published co-first-author paper in *Science* (130+ citations), a second-author paper in *Nature Communications* (25+ citations), and a co-authored review article with 300+ citations
- Received a competitive NIH Postdoctoral Fellowship (NRSA F32)

### Independent Projects

***

**Project ESPAÑOL** [(https://github.com/dmerullo/project-espanol)](https://github.com/dmerullo/project-espanol){target="_blank"} \
*Application that leverages high-throughput analysis of classical Spanish-language poems to create custom lesson plans and guide discovery of new texts for practice and study*

- Used the R package `rvest` to scrape 10,000 Spanish-language poems in the public domain from 200 authors across 500 years, totaling 2.5 million words
- Performed an unsupervised clustering analysis in Python to group the poems into 4 difficulty levels by analyzing the frequencies of 10,000+ conjugated verb forms for the 550+ most common verbs
- Created a Plotly Dash application for exploring the full texts, metadata, and grammatical statistics
  
### Selected Publications (600+ citations total)
