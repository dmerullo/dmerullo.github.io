# Biomarkers and genomic medicine

*at Parexel International*

In my current role at a clinical research organization for a major pharmaceutical client, I perform data ingestion and develop ETL pipelines for genomic sequencing datasets (GWAS & xQTL) from clinical study populations to identify specific variations in the genome that may relate to disease and illness. As part of the biomarkers and genomic medicine team, I'm a link between the scientific analysts who require efficient management of this data at scale, and the data scientists/engineers who lack familiarity with bioinformatics methods and resources.

*Examples of tools created for internal client use:*

-   Lift over genomic regions from datasets on human genome build 37 to build 38
-   Update genomic coordinates for rsIDs from older builds of dbSNP
-   Generate custom entity flat files for xQTL studies

# Neural cell types and circuits for vocal learning

*at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in the [Roberts lab](https://labs.utsouthwestern.edu/roberts-lab){target="_blank"} and [Konopka lab](https://konopkalab.org/){target="_blank"}*

My post-doctoral research used comparative high-throughput transcriptomics to understand how the brain produces complex, learned behaviors like speech and language. These projects were the first to implement single-cell RNA sequencing in songbirds, establishing a template for the field from molecular to computational components, and the results have broad implications for understanding the genetic toolkits that neurons and circuits use to perform advanced computations.

# Neuromodulators of motivation and reward in vocal communication

*at University of Wisconsin-Madison in the [Riters lab](https://integrativebiology.wisc.edu/staff/riters-lauren/){target="_blank"}*

My doctoral dissertation examined the neural control of vocal communication across contexts in songbirds. I identified neurotensin, a neuropeptide involved in motivation and reward that strongly interacts with dopamine, as a potential modulator of context-specific vocalizations. By establishing links between neurotensin and vocal communication for the first time, this research also contributed to a better understanding of neurotensin's role in the regulation of social behavior more generally.
