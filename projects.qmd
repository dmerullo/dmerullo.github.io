# Genomic biomarkers

*at Parexel International*

In my current role at a clinical research organization for a major pharmaceutical client, I perform data ingestion and develop ETL pipelines for genomic sequencing datasets (GWAS & xQTL) from clinical study populations to identify specific variations in the genome that may relate to disease and illness. As part of the biomarkers and genomic medicine team, I'm a link between the scientific analysts who require efficient management of this data at scale, and the data scientists/engineers who lack familiarity with bioinformatics methods and resources.

# Neural cell types and circuits for vocal learning in songbirds

*at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in the [Roberts lab](https://labs.utsouthwestern.edu/roberts-lab) and [Konopka lab](https://konopkalab.org/)*

My post-doctoral research used comparative high-throughput transcriptomics to understand how the brain produces complex, learned behaviors like speech and language. These projects were the first to implement single-cell RNA sequencing in songbirds, establishing a template for the field from molecular to computational components, and the results have broad implications for understanding the genetic toolkits that neurons and circuits use to perform advanced computations.

# Neuromodulators of motivation and reward in vocal communication

*at University of Wisconsin-Madison in the [Riters lab](https://integrativebiology.wisc.edu/staff/riters-lauren/)*

My doctoral dissertation examined the neural control of vocal communication across contexts in songbirds. I identified neurotensin, a neuropeptide that strongly interacts with dopamine, as a potential modulator of context-specific vocalizations in songbirds. By establishing links between neurotensin and vocal communication for the first time, this research also contributed to a better understanding of this neuropeptide and the mechanisms of social behavior more generally.
