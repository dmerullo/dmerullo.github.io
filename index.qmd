I am a research scientist with experience in a variety of projects across data science, data engineering, and scientific computing. I specialize in developing scalable, high-performance methods for translating novel data into functional insights and resources. My background is in biomedical research in both private industry and academia, and I am interested in analytics and product development more generally as a way to integrate data from diverse external sources into cohesive frameworks to guide decisions and create solutions for complex problems.
