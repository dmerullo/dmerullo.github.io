title: "About"

I am a research scientist experienced in data engineering, scientific computing, and informatics. My goal is to develop scalable, efficient methods for translating novel data into functional resources. The main languages I use include R, Python, Julia, Bash, and SQL. For high-performance and cloud computing, I am familiar with Linux, GCP, and HDFS.

In my current role at a clinical research organization for a major pharmaceutical client, I perform data ingestion and develop ETL pipelines for genomic sequencing datasets (GWAS & xQTL). As part of the biomarkers and genomic medicine team, I'm a link between the scientific analysts who require efficient management of this data at scale, and the data scientists/engineers who lack familiarity with bioinformatics methods and resources.

For my PhD and postdoctoral research in neuroscience, I used techniques from molecular biology and bioinformatics to understand how the brain produces complex, learned behaviors like speech and language.
