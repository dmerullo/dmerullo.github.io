I am a research scientist with experience in a variety of projects across data science, data engineering, and scientific computing. My expertise includes developing scalable, high-performance methods for translating novel data into functional insights and resources. With a background in biomedical research in both industry and academia, I am also broadly interested in analytics and product development as a way to integrate data from diverse external sources into cohesive frameworks to guide decisions and create solutions.
