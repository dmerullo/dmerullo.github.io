I am a research scientist with experience in a variety of projects across data science, data analytics, and scientific computing. My expertise includes translating large-scale data into functional insights and resources by developing solutions across teams and disciplines. With a background in biomedical research in both industry and academia, I am also broadly interested in data-driven technologies and product development to guide decisions and solve complex problems.
