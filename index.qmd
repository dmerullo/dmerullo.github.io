I am a research scientist experienced in data engineering, scientific computing, and informatics. My goal is to develop scalable, high-performance methods for translating novel data into functional resources. The main languages I use include R, Python, Julia, Bash, and SQL. For high-performance and cloud computing, I am familiar with Linux, GCP, and HDFS.
