I am a research scientist experienced in data science, data engineering, and scientific computing. My current specialty is developing scalable, high-performance methods for translating novel data into functional insights and resources. All of my projects have centered around topics like information, computation, and communication, and I view product development as a way to integrate data from diverse external sources into a cohesive framework to guide decisions and create solutions for complex problems.

The main languages I use include R, Python, Julia, Bash, and SQL. For high-performance and cloud computing, I am familiar with Linux, GCP, and HDFS.
