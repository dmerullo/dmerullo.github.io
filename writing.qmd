I've started a [Substack](https://dmerullo.substack.com/){target="_blank"} for creative nonfiction. Inspired by [POSSE-- Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere-- from the IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/POSSE){target="_blank"}, I'm hosting the articles here as well. Since I can now display the pieces in a specific order, unlike on Substack, I recommend viewing this arrangement as if it were the track listing for an album not yet finished.

*Your readership is more than enough. Still, if you'd like to [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/dmerullo){target="_blank"}, itâ€™s the clearest signal to keep writing.*
