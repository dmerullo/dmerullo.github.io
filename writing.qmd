I've started a Substack, titled [*Compass and Candle*](https://dmerullo.substack.com/){target="_blank"}, to explore topics that interest me. To maintain ownership and control of my writing, I'm practicing [POSSE-- Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere-- from the IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/POSSE){target="_blank"}, so I'm hosting my articles here as well. Although you can read these pieces in whatever order you'd like, I recommend viewing this arrangement as if it were the track listing for a full album.

*Your readership is more than enough. Still, if you'd like to [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/dmerullo){target="_blank"}, itâ€™s the clearest signal to keep writing.*
