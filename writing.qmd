I've started a [Substack](https://dmerullo.substack.com/){target="_blank"} for creative nonfiction. Inspired by POSSE-- [Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE){target="_blank"}-- from the IndieWeb, I'm hosting the articles here as well. Additionally, unlike on Substack, I can now display the pieces in a specific order.

*Your readership is more than enough. Still, if you'd like to [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/dmerullo){target="_blank"}, it’s the clearest signal to keep writing.*
