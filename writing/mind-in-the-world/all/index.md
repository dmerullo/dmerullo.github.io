# Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Carolina Gonzales and Jeremy Spool for their helpful comments and inspiration to create this project.

I wrote each section in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/){target="_blank"}, which is a graphical editor for [Markdown files](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/){target="_blank"}, and then used [Quarto](https://quarto.org/){target="_blank"} to render everything into the format you see here.
