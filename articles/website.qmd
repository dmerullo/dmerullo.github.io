I made this site using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I recommend following [the documentation from Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html) for using the two together. 

The [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) has great documentation for configuring your website. I'm using the `flatly` theme.

I used the [Iconify extension for Quarto](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-iconify) to add the link icons on the About page. There are [many other extensions available](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/) for Quarto.
